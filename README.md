### Hi there 👋

My name is Ingryd and I'm a brazilian web-developer in the making! :star2:
I'm self-taught and currently taking my first steps with JavaScript but I also mess around with HTML5 and CSS3. 
I look foward to learning more and sharing content as well. :grinning:

Oh, I'm trying social media detoxing but you still can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/huntingpearls), most of my tweets are in portuguese though. :sweat_smile:
